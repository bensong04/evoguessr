# FROGTOAST (FROm Gene-trees TO A Species Tree )
Heuristic constructing species trees from gene trees

We implement Symmetric Duplication cost metric defined in: https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539798343362 
and test various search paradigms to explore tree space.

We define a new tree rearrangement method we call SubtreeSwap and test against methods mentioned in the paper.
